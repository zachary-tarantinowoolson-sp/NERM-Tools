// This is the service worker script, which executes in its own context
// when the extension is installed or refreshed (or when you access its console).

console.log("service worker started")

// not sure how servicer worker should work yet. This is just here so the extension will pass registration

// will probably add Message Passing in here so console logs can go from the pop up to the main tab console
